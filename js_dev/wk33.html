           manchester United are in desperate need of a positive result when they return to Premier League action against Fulham tonight.

            United got a vital victory over Rangers in the Europa League on Thursday but it came at a cost in two defensive casualties.
            
            Matthijs de Ligt was forced off at half-time, replaced by Harry Maguire, with Leny Yoro following 10 minutes later.
            
            While Ruben Amorim did not disclose the exact nature of the knocks, he suggested United will exercise extreme caution over the fitness of the pair, leaving them major doubts for tonight’s clash in the capital.
            
            ‘He [De Ligt] has a pain. So he cannot risk [it]. Leny felt pain also, so he cannot risk [it],’ Amorim told MUTV.
            
            ‘We have a lot of different players that can play so it was that. We cannot lose anybody.’

            Noussair Mazraoui meanwhile missed the win over Rangers with a minor injury of his own and while his absence was thought to be a precautionary one, it remains to be seen whether he will be involved on Sunday.
